# Langmuir MR-1 configuration for LinuxCNC

My LinuxCNC configuration for the Langmuir MR-1 gantry mill.

Notes on the configuration:
* This uses the stock MR1 stepper drivers, spindle (servo) drive, and tool probes.
* They are connected to the PC running LinuxCNC using a MESA 7i96S.
* Tool changes use probing to set the tool height.  This uses the Langmuir probe and tool setter.
